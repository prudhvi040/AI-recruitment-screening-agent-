🤖 AI Recruitment Screening Agent

An AI-powered recruitment assistant that automates resume screening, candidate evaluation, and shortlisting based on a given job description.

This project demonstrates how AI agents and workflow automation can be used to solve a real-world hiring problem: manually reviewing resumes is slow, inconsistent, and difficult to scale.
The AI Recruitment Screening Agent streamlines this process by analyzing resumes, scoring candidates, and generating structured hiring insights.



📌 Problem Statement

Recruiters and hiring managers often spend hours reviewing resumes, comparing candidates, and identifying the best fit for a role. This process is:

-Time-consuming
-Prone to human bias and inconsistency
-Difficult to scale when applicant volume is high

This project was built to show how agentic AI workflows can automate early-stage recruitment screening while keeping the process structured, transparent, and explainable.



🚀 What This Agent Does

The AI Recruitment Screening Agent:

-Accepts a job description and multiple resumes
-Extracts key job requirements (skills, tools, experience)
-Evaluates each candidate against the role
-Assigns a match score (out of 100)
-Identifies strengths, weaknesses, and gaps
-Ranks candidates from best to least suitable
-Recommends the top candidate with a clear justification

The output is delivered in a clean, structured format suitable for recruiters and hiring teams.
